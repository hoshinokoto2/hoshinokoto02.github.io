This is my second project making html games using Phaser 3.

Since my mom likes Ghibli movies very much, I decided to make a game using characters from Ghibli Studio as a gift for Mother's Day. However, I couldn't give her the gift on time because I wanted to put many mini games inside the game, and it took me more than I thought to debug all of the problems and make all of the games work well. Anyway, I finally finish the whole game! Even though it's still not perfect as I wanted, I have to give it to my mom before it's tooooo late! XDDD

If you happened to have played this game, I hope you enjoy it!! :) 

Here's the link to the game: https://hoshinokoto2.github.io/
